# bank-lc-sim
A simulator for a simple bank using the LendingClub public loan data set

## data
Download the Lending Club data file `loan.csv` from the kaggle site https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data into the `./data/` directory (it is too large for git).

## play
Use the notebooks in `./notebooks/` to prepare the data, build the classifier, and simulate the bank.

Some notebooks begin by loading a pickle file generated by the previous step -- these can be found in the box folder.

* Prepare data: `prepare-data.ipynb`
* Experiment with training the classifier: `compare-training.ipynb`
* Train the core features classifier used in the simulation: `train-on-core-features.ipynb`
* Run the bank lending simulation: `bank-simulater.ipynb`

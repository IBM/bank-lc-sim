Use the notebooks in `./notebooks/` to prepare the data, build the classifier, and simulate the bank.

Some notebooks begin by loading a pickle file generated by the previous step -- these can be found in the box folder.

* Prepare data: `prepare-data.ipynb`
* Experiment with training the classifier: `compare-training.ipynb`
* Train the core features classifier used in the simulation: `train-on-core-features.ipynb`
* Run the bank lending simulation: `bank-simulater.ipynb`
